Your Sponsor a Mile page lets supporters pick specific miles to sponsor and add a dedication for you to carry during your run.

**Ways to share:**

- **Text/WhatsApp:** Send your link directly to friends and family
- **Email:** Include it in your fundraising emails
- **Social media:** Post it on Instagram, Facebook, etc.

## Step 3: Use the Graphics

We've created ready-to-use Instagram/Facebook Story graphics to help you promote your fundraising.

**Graphics page:** https://mendg.github.io/team-friendship-graphics/

**How to use:**
1. Open the page on your computer
2. Click any orange-outlined text to customize (your URL, mile count, etc.)
3. Screenshot the story (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac, or Windows+Shift+S on PC)
4. Post to Instagram Stories, Facebook Stories, or WhatsApp Status

**Best graphics for Sponsor a Mile:**
- "Pick Your Mile / Own the Moment"
- "26 Miles / Which One is Yours?" (shows the mile grid!)
- "The Finish Line is Still Open"
- "Miles Are Going Fast" (great for urgency)

## How Sponsorships Work

1. Supporter visits your page
2. They pick a mile and enter their dedication
3. They're directed to your Neon Fundraise page to donate
4. Once payment is confirmed, their mile appears on your page (within 24 hours)

**Note:** Sponsors should use the same email when donating so we can match it to their mile selection.

## Tips for Success

1. **Share early and often** - Don't wait until race week
2. **Make it personal** - Tell people WHY you're running
3. **Highlight the dedications** - "Someone can sponsor mile 13.1 in memory of a loved one"
4. **Create urgency** - "Only 8 miles left!" works great
5. **Thank publicly** - Share when miles get sponsored to encourage others
